    # List of supported by tinydns and actual formula records:
    #   SOA: start of authority (delegate child zone to another nameserver)
    #   NS: nameserver which serves zone
    #   A: map FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) to IP address
    #   PTR: map IP address to FQDN (reverse DNS)
    #   MX: mail server which serves zone
    #   TXT: text record associated with domain. Can be usable (for instance) for Google Domain Verification
    #   CNAME: map one domain name to another (FQDN or not)
    #
    # IMPORTANT NOTE: for workability any record in your zone you MUST specify SOA record for this or parent zone
    #

    # Example of salt://dns/mydomain.com
    #  .my.domain.com::dns.domain.com
    #  =pass.my.domain.com:33.33.33.33
